          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Our Video Consultation Service uses technology to allow our <br>veterinary team to assist you when we’re not able to provide <br>care and treatment in the surgery – which is particularly <br>important during the current COVID-19 situation.</p>
          <p>Using a technology platform, our vets can give you general <br>advice, help monitor and update treatment for pets already <br>under our care. In certain circumstances, we may be able to <br>provide veterinary attention to new cases, where no other <br>more suitable arrangements can be made. </p>
